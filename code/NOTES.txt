I've just completed checking the SWORD text for differences between it
and my text.  Apart from extraneous text in verse 0 in some chapters,
and apart from text that is misplaced, there are no significant
differences that are not accounted for by my changes to Clint Yale's
text.  Thus it is basically Clint Yale's text.

2005-07-02 15:59:

I had to remove the code that checks for equality except for final S
or final N.  There was a case where WH had TH=S but Tischendorf had
TH=|, which didn't get caught.

This brought about 42 instances which did not get parsed, of which 34
were unique pairs of WH and Tischendorf.

I added the ones that were simple spelling differences to word.py, and
added the two that needed a parsing to lexicon.py.

This brought about some differences in stuff that was now ambiguous
where it had not been before, or was not unambiguous where it had been
ambiguous before.  So I added or removed whatever was necessary
to/from manual_analyses.txt.


2005-07-03 03:30am

Heb 12:11.3 PAIDIA (children), I chose to analyze as though it were
PAIDEIA (rearing). This is because it has to agree with PASA (N-GSF)
in 12:11.1, but PAIDIA is N-APN/N-NPN/N-VPN 3813.

2005-07-03 04:15am

Re 17:3.18: Is EXONTA V-PAP-ASM or V-PAP-NPN here?  It refers to the
Beast which the woman is riding, which is neuter singular.  Yet the
preceding GEMONTA is APN, presumably referring to both the woman and
the beast.  I have chosen to say V-PAP-ASM, agreeing in case and not
in gender.

2005-07-03 04:25am

FINISHED DISAMBIGUATING!


2005-07-03 05:22am

Just added code to use the manual_analyses.txt file.

==> Just learned that 94 words are not analyzed at all because there
is no such verse in Westcott Hort.

And another 25 words now need disambiguation.

2005-07-03 06:35am

Nope, it's not so bad. 25 words still need disambiguation, but after I
had bugfixed the new code to add manual_analyses, only 1 word remains
unanalyzed.

2005-07-03 06:50am

Disambiguated those 25 words.

2005-07-04 06:00am

Found out that the manual analyses were not always applied: Sometimes,
the algorithm would skip ahead.  Changed it so that it always takes
the preference of a manual analysis if needing to skip.

This brought up 86 new words to be disambiguated.

2005-07-04 06:40am

It turned out that I could change the algorithm yet again and avoid
disambiguating those 86 words.  At this time, however, I had already
disambiguated some of them.

The algorithm now:

1) First applies all manual analyses, then
2) When it compares with WH:

   a) it skips those words that already have an analysis, and 
   b) if something compares equal, it doesn't alter any existing
      analysis (i.e., from the manual analyses).



2005-07-07 07:03pm

Yesterday, I asked Dr. Robinson about EUQUS being 2112 rather than
2117.  Strong's has 2117 as EU)QU/S, and 2112 and EU)QE/WS.
Dr. Robinson replied this:

------------ reply begins ------------
Believe it or not, this is deliberate on my part. 8-O

Strong dropped the ball by placing EUQEWS ("immediately") under the
same number as EUQEIAS ("straight"), when those two terms are quite
different from each other. At best, the adjective EUQUS and the adverb
EUQEWS are virtually interchangeable synonyms and should have been
grouped under the same number from the beginning or separate numbers
should have been assigned to all three (EUQUS, EUQEWS, EUQEIAS). Since
there were only two available numbers to work with, I reorganized, and
grouped EUQUS and EUQEWS under 2112, leaving EUQEIAS by itself at
2117.
------------ reply ends ------------

I have decided not to change his analysis.  Thus lexicon.py was
changed to make EUQUS be 2112 rather than 2117.


2005-08-23 04:29pm

I noticed that ANOICEI in RE 3:7.29 was analyzed as

RE 3:7.29 ANOICEI N-DSF 457 A)/NOICIS

However, this made no linguistic sense, as it needed to be a verb.  I
consulted Liddell-Scott and found that ANOI/GNUMI did indeed have a
future active indicative of ANOI/CW, and so this had to be:

RE 3:7.29 ANOICEI V-FAI-3S 455 A)NOI/GW

[Note: Check grammar before publishing!]

I proceeded to adding RE 3:7.29 to manual_analyses.txt.

ANOICEI appears in EPH 6:19.9 as follows:

EPH 6:19.9 ANOICEI N-DSF 457 A)/NOICIS

There, however, N-DSF 457 is the correct interpretation.



2005-10-08 04:55am

DU/O is indeclinable except in the dative (DUSI(N)), according to
Abbott-Smith and Perschbacher.  Strong's is silent on the issue,
whereas BDAG merely mentions that nom, gen & acc are the same.

Robinson parses non-dative as N-OI (Noun, indeclinable, other type),
whereas dative is parsed correctly.

I choose to leave DUO as N-OI even though it could be made more
explicit.


2005-10-08 04:58am

LU 23:53.12 OU ADV 3757

was added, since Robinson had misparsed it (I believe) as R-GSN.

It does mean "where" in this case, as BDAG also says (OU(=, 1.beta).


2005-10-08 04:59am

MONON ADV was misparsed as 3441 (it should be 3440) in two places:

MT 17:8.12 MONON ADV 3440
JAS 2:24.11 MONON ADV 3440



2005-10-08 06:13am

I did a study on PERISSOTERON.  It should be (according to Strong's)
either 4054 (in an adverbial sense) or 4055 (in an adjectival sense).
Robinson had parsed 12 instances as either 4053 (PERIOSSOS) or 4054.

I changed all to 4055, except for the following:


MR 7:36.13 PERISSOTERON ADV 4054
HEB 6:17.3 PERISSOTERON ADV 4054
HEB 7:15.2 PERISSOTERON ADV 4054

This was because BDAG listed these as having the adverbial sense.


2005-10-08 06:49am

PROTERON is 4386 in Strong's, but only when adverbial.

BDAG says that it is always adverbial, but can be used as an adjective.

I have changed all 9 instances to ADV-C 4386.

JOH 6:62.12 PROTERON ADV-C 4386
JOH 9:8.9 PROTERON ADV-C 4386
2CO 1:15.6 PROTERON ADV-C 4386
GA 4:13.11 PROTERON ADV-C 4386
1TI 1:13.2 PROTERON ADV-C 4386
HEB 4:6.10 PROTERON ADV-C 4386
HEB 7:27.10 PROTERON ADV-C 4386
HEB 10:32.4 PROTERON ADV-C 4386
1PE 1:14.7 PROTERON ADV-C 4386



2005-10-08 06:58am

I had misparsed PRWTON as ADV instead of ADV-S on two occasions in
manual_analyses.txt:

MR 9:11.16 PRWTON ADV 4412
MR 16:9.7 PRWTON ADV 4412

These have been fixed to ADV-S, bringing them into accord with all the
other instances of PRWTON 4412.



2005-10-08 07:07am

SOI is ambiguous between:

SOI S-2NPM 4674 SO/S

and

SOI P-2DS 4771 SU/

Robinson parses it as 4674 in three places:

JOH 17:6.13 SOI S-2NPM 4674
LU 5:33.21 SOI S-2NPM 4674
MR 2:18.27 SOI S-2NPM 4674

That's correct in all three cases.

I have checked that the ones I have in manual_analyses.txt are indeed
P-2DS 4771:

MT 12:47.16 SOI P-2DS 4771
JOH 1:51.8 SOI P-2DS 4771
JOH 18:34.10 SOI P-2DS 4771
3JO 1:15.2 SOI P-2DS 4771
RE 17:7.9 SOI P-2DS 4771

I haven't checked whether all the other instances of SOI really are
meant to be P-2DS 4771, as they are parsed as.


2005-10-08 07:22am

All forms of OU(=TOS beginning with TOU have been reclassified into
Strong's number 3778 in lexicon.py.  Before, they were in their
separate categories 5124-5130, but Dr. Robinson had standardized on
3778, so I follow suit.

Also, manual_analyses.txt had some of these, but I reclassified them
as well into 3778.


2005-10-08 07:33am

UPARXONTA is ambiguous between 5224 (as noun) and 5225 (as verb).  In
all cases where UPARXONTA is preceded by an article, Robinson parses
it as 5224, whereas in all other cases, it is parsed as 5225.  I
believe this is correct.  The only possible exception might be 2PE
1:8.4, where the participle is preceded by TAUTA, but I believe it is
really a verbal participle here (if that's the right term).


2005-10-08 07:39am

I discovered that Strong's has the lemma XRU/SEOS for 5552, whereas
ANLEX has XRUSOU=S.  I changed the lemmatable to conform to Strong's.


2005-10-08 07:43am

WOOHOOO!  I finished checking the ambiguities in the
tischlexicon_nonunique.txt.

2005-10-08 07:51am

Checking that N-PRI really are indeclinable:

- BHQSAIDA(N) is indeclinable according to BDAG, so I leave it as
  such, even though Thayer mentions that BHQSAIDAN could be the
  accusative (but then says that it may also just be an alteration).
  ANLEX says it's indeclinable.



2005-10-09 03:16pm

Just finished "proof-reading" lemmatable.txt.

I did this by taking the Public Domain Strong's dictionary in raw
format from SWORD, then extracting the headwords with an awk script (I
had already done this), then writing a small Python program to
transform the lemmatable into something that resembled the headword
list from Strong's, then doing a diff between the two, then carefully
checking each and every instance of a mismatch.

612 lemmas were changed.


2005-10-09 04:18pm

1) Reclassified UPEREKPERISSOU as 5228&4053 (not 4055): 4053 is
   PERI/SSOS, whereas 4055 is PERISSO/TEROS.

2) Reclassified MHPOU as CONJ-N (not CONJ).  It was decided to leave
   it as CONJ, not ADV-N or PRT-N, since BDAG says that MHPOU is a
   conjunction (see POU/ section 2).

3) Reclassified MHPWS as CONJ-N (not CONJ).

4) Reclassified EIGE as 1489 (not 1490).

5) Reclassified DIATI as PRT-I (not PRT).

6) Reclassified EKPERISSWS as 1537&4053 rather than 4055.

7) Reclassified PERISSOTERWS as 4056 (not 4057).

8) Reclassified EKTENESTERON as ADV-C rather than ADV (LU 22:44.5;
   1617).

9) Reclassified PERISSOTERON ADV 4054 as ADV-C.

10) Reclassified TOLMHROTERON ADV 5112 as ADV-C.

11) Reclassified USTERON ADV 5305 as ADV-C.

12) Reclassified KATWTERW ADV 2736 as ADV-C (MT 2:16.29).

13) Reclassified AKRIBESTERON ADV-C 199 as 197.

14) Fixed typo in lemmatable: 957 is BELTI/ON, not BELTI/WN.



2005-10-09 07:15pm

I finally got around to actually using the analytical TischLexicon in
assigning unique, unambiguous entries before attempting a match.

After some bugfixing, it ran beautifully.

I then updated the lexicon so that the following was changed:

27,33c27,34
<                         "UMIN" : ("4771", "P-2DP"),
<                         "UMWN" : ("4771", "P-2GP"),
<                         "UMAS" : ("4771", "P-2AP"),
<                         "UMEIS" : ("4771", "P-2NP"),
<                         "HMIN" : ("1473", "P-1DP"),
<                         "HMAS" : ("1473", "P-1AP"),
<                         "HMEIS" : ("1473", "P-1NP"),
---
>                         "UMIN" : ("5210", "P-2DP"),
>                         "UMWN" : ("5210", "P-2GP"),
>                         "UMAS" : ("5210", "P-2AP"),
>                         "UMEIS" : ("5210", "P-2NP"),
>                         "HMIN" : ("2248", "P-1DP"),
>                         "HMAS" : ("2248", "P-1AP"),
>                         "HMEIS" : ("2248", "P-1NP"),
>                         "HMWN" : ("2248", "P-1GP"),

This was because for the S- entries, it was split between singular and
plural.


I ran the stuff, and found that the following had also changed:

> MT 17:4.26 HLEIA N-GSM 2243 *(HLI/AS
> MR 3:27.14 DIARPASAI V-AAS-3S 1283 DIARPA/ZW
> MR 9:5.24 HLEIA N-GSM 2243 *(HLI/AS
> LU 9:33.32 HLEIA N-GSM 2243 *(HLI/AS
> LU 24:47.15 ARCAMENOI V-AMP-NPM 756 A)/RXOMAI
> RO 11:2.14 HLEIA N-GSM 2243 *(HLI/AS
> RE 18:3.10 PEPWKAN V-RAI-3P 4095 PI/NW

The *(HLIA/S entries were all N-GSM because that's what was in the
lexicon, but of course that is both *(HLIA and *(HLIA|, the latter
being dative.  So I changed the lexicon to be ambiguous here.

This brought the differences (apart from HMEIS/UMEIS) down to:

> LU 24:47.15 ARCAMENOI V-AMP-NPM 756 A)/RXOMAI
> MR 3:27.14 DIARPASAI V-AAS-3S 1283 DIARPA/ZW
> RE 18:3.10 PEPWKAN V-RAI-3P 4095 PI/NW

About LU 24:47.15: It is absolutely correct, since A)/RXOMAI (756) is
the middle voice of A)/RXW (757).  It was 757 before, but 756 is
actually what the other instances of ARCAMENOI are.

About MR 3:27.14: It is actually V-AAN, not V-AAS-3S.  Lexicon.py was
corrected.

About RE 18:3.10: It should be 4095 PI/NW, as I had written in the
lexicon.  word.py had PEPTWKAN as a substitute for PEPWKAN, which was
wrong!


2005-10-22

09:14am

I've made a bunch of updates to the WH-Parsed text.  They are now
reflected in the Tischendorf Parsed CVS directory.  NOTE: The changes
have been made in WHParsed, even though they are not authorized by
Dr. Robinson yet.


2005-10-22

09:14am

I found that

AC 17:20.3 TINA X-APN 5100

was unaccented in Tischendorf's printed, but accented (TI/NA) in
Westcott-Hort.  To keep it as X-APN 5100 (which is TI\S), I needed to
add the above line to manual_analyses.txt.


2005-10-22

09:19am

I believe that in the following text from Luke 12:25:

TI/S DE\ E)C U(MW=N MERIMNW=N DU/NATAI PROSQEI=NAI E)PI\ TH\N
H(LIKI/AN AU)TOU= PH=XUN;

MERIMNW=N is really a participle:

LU 12:25.5 MERIMNWN V-PAP-NSM 3309

rather than a noun:

LU 12:25.5 MERIMNWN N-GSF 3308

I have changed manual_analyses.txt accordingly.



2005-10-22

10:12am

I've now added ANLEX lemmas.


2005-10-22
10:14am

I decided that it was ugly to have special cases for strongs&strongs,
so I removed those from the code.  This is because Robinson did
without them, so many more cases like them would have to be introduced
to be consistent.

The new principle is that the most important word of the combination
is used as the basis for the Strong's number.


In particular, the following changes were made:

I ran two queries, 2228-N-NSF.mql and 1722-not-dative.mql.  The first
one turned up no surprises, but the second turned me on to something
that Clint Yale had missed in preparing the text, namely an E)N in
Mark 10:44 which needed to be deleted.

(W-H has E)N U(MI=N, whereas Tischendorf just has U(MW=N.)



2005-10-22

11:01am

I ran another query, 1519-not-accusative (EIS), and found another bug
in Clint Yale's text:

diff -r1.11 LU.TSP
18454c18454
< LU 23:42.8 EIS PREP 1519 EI)S ! EI)S
---
> LU 23:42.8 EN PREP 1722 E)N ! E)N



2005-10-22

11:27am

I ran some more queries.  One of them found a bug in
manual_analyses.txt:


diff -r1.55 manual_analyses.txt
797c798,799
< 2PE 3:13.8 TA T-NPN 3588
---
> 2PE 3:13.8 TA T-APN 3588
> 2PE 3:13.9 EPAGGELMATA N-APN 1862

What comes before TA is KATA, so it needs to be accusative, not
nominative!


2005-10-22

11:43am

I ran some more, this time 4012-not-genitive-nor-accusative.mql turned
up another textual error:

17301c17301
< LU 22:37.21 EMOI P-1DS 1473 E)GW/ ! E)GW/
---
> LU 22:37.21 EMOU P-1GS 1473 E)GW/ ! E)GW/

Thus EMOI= is really EMOU=.I checked against the facsimile: It is an
understandable mistake on Clint Yale's part, since it does look like
an iota, missing the right part of the upsilon. However:

1) there is a circumflex accent over it, and 

2) it curves downwards to the left, showing that it really is meant to
be an upsilon. Also, 

3) the word before it is PERI, which does not take the dative, but
which does take the genitive.

I found out (running a query on EPI) that in John 8:3, something had flown under my radar, namely this:

5739c5739

---
> JOH 8:3.9 AMARTEIA N-ASF 266 A(MARTI/A ! A(MARTI/A

The word before it is EPI, which of course does not take nominative,
but accusative.


2005-10-22

12:06am

The same (EPI) query turned up another textual error:

1277c1277

I checked it against the facsimile.

I am looking at lexicon_nonunique.txt for neuter accusative and
nominative singular and plural nouns that are unique.  Those may or
may not be unique, since the forms are often the same in accusative
and nominative.

I dug up Luke 14:12, where this was changed:


11870c11870
< LU 14:12.9 ARISTON N-NSN 712 A)/RISTON ! A)/RISTON
---
> LU 14:12.9 ARISTON N-ASN 712 A)/RISTON ! A)/RISTON

Found out that RE 10:8 had a textual error (still going through list
of accusative/nominative neuter nouns).

4077c4077

Still going through the list of neuters.

3146,3147c3146,3147
< RO 8:4.2 TO T-ASN 3588 O( ! O(
< RO 8:4.3 DIKAIWMA N-ASN 1345 DIKAI/WMA ! DIKAI/WMA
---
> RO 8:4.2 TO T-NSN 3588 O( ! O(
> RO 8:4.3 DIKAIWMA N-NSN 1345 DIKAI/WMA ! DIKAI/WMA

I think this is nominative, because it is the subject of the passive
verb.

I'm calling it quits for now.

Command to get the list of neuter nouns:

grep -v "/" tischlexicon_nonunique.txt | grep "N\-[AN].N" | wc -l

That gets me (right now) 326 lines.

I've done through Delta, which means I have 257 to go:

Just spent about 3 hours correcting the text by comparing it with
Clint Yale's accented text.

This led to some changes in the parsing.

The following was added to lexicon.py:

"AXELDAMAX" : ("184", "N-PRI")

This was previously AKELDAMAX, but Tischendorf spelled it AXELDAMAX.


In a previous session, I added machinery to print a "stripped" version
of Clint Yale's accented text, which he had sent me and which I had
extracted from his SGML.



2005-12-05 08:36am

I've been going through the text, using the diffs between Clint Yale's
Accented Tischendorf and the unaccented text, since around 07:00am.

One thing worth mentioning now: In MR 14:64, the printed text has
FAI/NE-NETAI.  This, of course, makes no sense, as you cannot have an
accent on the ante-ante-penult (if that's what it is called).  So I've
left the text as FAINETAI, thinking it is one of those cases where the
text is "typographically challenged", as Clint Yale so aptly puts it
in his introduction to his Tischendorf.



2005-12-05 08:50am

Came to Matthew 6:4; saw that the senses of H( and H)=| had been
reversed; added them to manual_analyses.txt.  This was because WH had
H)=| for H(.





2005-12-05 09:22am

In RE 17:14, there is another "typographically challenged" word:
SU)TOU/S, which I've chosen to let it stay as AU)TOUS.


2005-12-05 09:33am

Just finished what I started around 7:00am, namely checking the ~1800
lines of diffs between Clint Yale's accented text and the unparsed
text.


2005-12-05 09:59am

In MR 8:4, the word NH/STIS occurs.

I think this is a typographically challenged form of NH/STEIS, for the
following reasons:

1) It should be NH=STIS, since the ultima is short (IS).
2) But it is NH/STIS, indicating that the ultima should have been long.
3) Therefore, we may infer a missing epsilon, meaning NH/STEIS.
4) This makes contextually sense, since Jesus is speaking about the
   crowds, and if he sends them away "hungry" (A-APM) to their house,
   some of them will falter on the way.  It would not have made sense
   to say NH=STIS, since they are plural, and NH=STIS is singular.

I have decided to:

a) Leave the text as it is (NHSTIS), and
b) Parse it as A-APM.



2005-12-05 10:19am

In MR 14:65.12, KOLAFIZEN occurs.  This is not a form of Koine Greek,
so far as I know, since it should have had the augment if it really
ended in ZEN.  But Tischendorf's apparatus says that KOLFAIZEIN is the
text intended, so that is how I have parsed it:

MR 14:65.12 KOLAFIZEN V-PAN 2852



2005-12-05 10:31am

One of the textual changes was LU 23:33.3:

LU 23:33.3 APHLQON V-2AAI-3P 565

This is ambiguous between V-2AAI-1S and the parsing above.  It should
be 3P because the rest of the sentence is 3P.




2005-12-05 10:36am

Another textual change which is only a typographically challenged
version of something real:

JOH 6:23.13 EUXARISTHTANTOS V-AAP-GSM 2168

The apparatus says the intended meaning is EUXARISTHSANTOS.  The
-TANTOS is on the next page, so that may be why the error crept in.



2005-12-05 11:04am

In RE 18:12.23, we find:

QU/I+ON

since all the lexica agree that this should be QU/I+NON, I have parsed
it as such, but left it as QU/I+ON.

Just to restate something I wrote earlier:

I need to go through all nominative and accusative neuter forms that
are unique in the lexicon, since they may or may not be unique (they
are often the same on the surface, but may be either case).

Since they are unique in the lexicon, it means they only occur in that
case.  I need to check that they have the right case.

RE.TSP:RE 21:16.20 STADIWN N-GPN 4712 STA/DION ! STA/DION

All of these are neuter.

Strong grouped both words under 4712, so no dice in distinguishing
them by Strong's number.

I decided to change manual_analyses.txt to make the ones that are
clearly masculine, masculine.

Going through the list of lemmas which, in ANLEX, have a roman numeral
in parentheses.

Found that DOU=LOS 1401 needed to be DOU=LON 1400 (ANLEX: DOU=LOS
[1I]1) in the following places:

diff -r1.62 manual_analyses.txt
652a653,654

2005-12-10  11:06pm

I found out that H)=XOS exists in two lemmas:

H)=XOS, -OU, O(  which in ANLEX is given the designation H)=XOS [11]1

H)=XOS, -OUS, TO/  which in ANLEX is given the designation H)=XOS [1II]1

Now, the neuter only occurs in LU 21:25.18 (according to BDAG),
whereas the masculine occurs in AC 2:2.7, HEB 12:19.3, and LU 4:37.3.

Strong's has only one entry for this, so I can't distinguish the
lemmas by the Strong's number.

ANLEX cuts the cake differently, and says (with BDAG) that HE 12:19 is
masculine, but calls the others neuters.

Since the masculine occurs more often, I have decided to change the
[1II]1 to [1I]1 in lemmatable_ANLEX.txt.

FIXME: Distinguish!

2005-12-11 04:57am

I spoke with Clint Yale for about an hour on the phone.  He gave me
permission to import the diacritics and punctuation from his big
Tischendorf.  (!)

Hence I've proof-read the Accented text, and have brought both it and
the Unparsed text into conformity with the printed Tischendorf,
reversing my decisions above to let the electronic edition not conform
to the printed edition when it was clear what was being meant.

This has brought the following changes:

2005-12-11 06:43am

I've rewritten the Python code to read straight from the Accented
Tischendorf, bypassing the Unparsed (and unaccented) text altogether.

I had to change manual_analyses.txt thusly:

2005-12-11 07:48am

I am converting to MQL as I write.  I have fixed quite a few textual
errors in the Accented text, found by letting the BETA2Unicode Python
code loose on the text.

I have retained the printed text throughout, EXCEPT for the following:


AC 27:21.15 W)=| INJ 5599 W)= ! W)=

here, I have removed the iota subscriptum, even though the printed
text has it.  AFAIK, there IS no such thing as W)=| in Unicode, so I
am leaving it out.


2005-12-11 08:06am

I found this:

RE 13:18.21 XCS/. A-NUI-ABB 5516 XCS ! XCS'

It does look like an acute accent, but it should be a ', as the ANLEX
lemma says, and as also is shown for, e.g. PROS KORINQIOUS A'.


2005-12-11 08:31am

With the new acented text, I had to mangle "\" into "\\", so that was
added to word.py.


--------------------------- 1.0 released ---------------------------


2005-12-16 12:58am

I received an email from Rick Brannan saying that three words were
missing in PHM 1:11.

diff -r1.65 manual_analyses.txt

> PHM 1:11.13 ANEPEMYA V-AAI-1S 375
> PHM 1:11.14 SOI P-2DS 4771

Rick had already corrected this as per the correct analysis above, so
I didn't send him any new files.


2005-12-19 2:24am

I've been at it since 2005-12-18 around 11pm.

I've hand-corrected the Unparsed and Accented texts according to a
list of corrections that Rick Brannan sent me.

A number of issues have come up.  I'll comment on others later; for
now:

1PE 5:8.12 TINA I-ASM 5101

Tischendorf has TI/NA here, which is why I say 5101 (TI/S), not 5101
(TI\S), even though the 5100 reading would make more sense.

A.T. Robertson's grammar has (p. 740) a note saying it is difficult to
decide sometimes between TI/S and TI\s, and mentions 1PE 5:8 as an
example of scholarly disagreement.  And who am I to disagree with
Tischendorf's placement of diacritics?


2005-12-19 2:38am

Another issue:

In RE 13:18, it says chi-xi-stigma (XC#2').  ANLEX has it as XCZ',
whereas Strong's has XC#2 (without the apostrophe).


2005-12-19 2:44am

Another issue:

AC 8:40.15 AU)TO\N P-ASM 846 AU)TO/S ! AU)TO/S

This is actually not in the printed Tischendorf, but I've decided to
let it into the text.  Rick Brannan says:

[Ac 8.40, Tisch v2 p73]
// addition/correction RWB
// note that 'AU)TO\N' is penciled in RelTech's Tisch8.
// The 'EDITIO TERTIA STEREOTYPA' of the

// (I have consulted the printed version of this edition)
// also has 'AU)TO\N'. And this conforms with NA/UBS, which

The RelTech he's referring to is the TC Ebind project at:

Forgot to say that SMURNAN/SMURNH --> ZMURNA/ZMURNH in word.py's

I made a list of all those words that are capitalized in their lemma,
but not capitalized in their surface form:

I changed the following textually:

Removed:

This was in order to be in conformity with the printed Tischendorf.

This only occurs once, in

However, ANLEX says that PEIQW/ is feminine, and since I (i.e.,
Robinson) am doing this as masculine, I thought I'd take away the
second lemma.

I found out that sometimes, there is a grave inside of words; so I
decided to check them out.  There are 101 of those.

2005-12-21 12:35am

Just spent about an hour and a half fixing the "Unicode2BETA.map"
TECkit mapping.

This was in order to get a BETA view of the log file that Rick Brannan
sent me today (i.e., 2005-12-20).



2005-12-26 03:11pm

Yesterday I began what I am doing again today: Going through a list of
words which are in Tischendorf but not in ANLEX.  Tim Friberg asked me
to find him all forms in all texts which I could lay my hands on which
were not in ANLEX, and so John Baima sent me a beatifully XML-ized
version of ANLEX.

There are currently 810 words in Tischendorf which are not in ANLEX.

Here are the ones I didn't change:

I discovered that a lot of the "errors" had to do with

*A) or *A)/

being coded instead of

*)A and *)/A

so now we're down to 740 instances.


Here are the ones I didn't change:

I discovered that the algorithm for doing lower-case got things wrong, as in:

*AU)TOI/ --> AUT)OI.

So I needed to rewrite that, and here are the ones I didn't change

I found a textual error in LU 10:34.21 (Luke):

< LU 10:34.21 PANDOXI/ON N-ASN 3829 PANDOXEI=ON ! PANDOXEI=ON
---
> LU 10:34.21 PANDOKI/ON N-ASN 3829 PANDOXEI=ON ! PANDOXEI=ON

However, it looks like PANDOXI/ON was better than PANDOKI/ON, even
though the latter is what is there.

So:

2005-12-26 10:30pm

Finished!


2006-01-03 02:21am

Today I incorporated 16 changes due to Dr. Robinson, and released
version 1.3.


--------------------------- 1.3 released ---------------------------


2006-02-10 02:29am

Found some bugs in word.py:

- BASILEU != BASILEUS (N-VSM vs N-NSM)
- SUGKEKERASMENOUS != SUNKEKERASMENOS (V-RPP-APM vs V-RPP-NSM)


2006-02-10 03:25am

MT 10:13.8 E)LQA/TW V-AAM-3S 2064 E)/RXOMAI ! E)/RXOMAI

That should be 2nd aorist!  But WHP has V-AAM-3S...


2006-02-10 04:02am

1CO 9:12.22 E)KKOPH\N N-ASF 1464 E)GKOPH/ ! E)GKOPH/

That should be the lemma "E)KKOPH/"...  But ANLEX has both E)GKOPH/
and E)KKOPH/ under the same entry.

There is no E)KKOPH/ in Strong's.



2006-02-10 04:37am

Still checking word.py...


SUGKLHRONOMOI != SUNKLHRONOMOIS

Turns out that I had added SUNKLHRONOMOIS also to lexicon.py, where I
had given it an analysis of N-DPM, which should be A-DPM.


2006-02-10 04:44am

Someone pointed out to me that the following should be changed:

884c884
< HEB 4:2.16 SUNKEKERASME/NOS V-RPP-APM 4786 SUGKERA/NNUMI ! SUGKERA/NNUMI
---
> HEB 4:2.16 SUNKEKERASME/NOS V-RPP-NSM 4786 SUGKERA/NNUMI ! SUGKERA/NNUMI


2006-02-11 10:24pm

Today I've spent all day working on other morphgnt projects -- and now
in the last 10 minutes, I've applied those changes to Tischendorf.

Also, Dr. Robinson sent me his latest files today as well (he did the
same yesterday, after I had informed him about the 2nd aorist -LQ-
problems.

Only changes to lemmas were made.


2006-02-11 11:20pm

I made it so (in lexicon.py) that OTOU (i.e., "O(/TOU" is always 3748
O(/STIS rather than 3755 O(/TOU.


2006-02-11 11:50pm

Corrected as follows:

182c182
< AC 1:10.17 E)SQH/SESI N-DPF 2067 E)/SQHSIS ! E)SQH/S
---
> AC 1:10.17 E)SQH/SESI N-DPF 2066 E)SQH/S ! E)SQH/S

this was done in manual_analyses.txt.

The reasoning goes like this:

a) 2066 is what means "clothing"; 2067 means "government".

b) ANLEX has E)SQH/SESI(N) as E)SQH/S, not E)/SQHSIS.


2006-02-14 00:56am

Reversed the decision of 2066 vs. 2067 from 2006-02-11 11:50pm.  It is
now 2067 again (see email from Dr. Robinson 2006-02-14 00:01am).

Reasons:

1) 2067 does mean "clothing, apparel".

2) E)SQH/SESI is clearly from the stem E)/SQHSIS, not from E)SQHS.


2006-03-14 21:55am

I'm at it again, intending to make a release.


2006-03-14 22:58am

I'm done (but have done other things as well.)



--------------------------- 1.4 released ---------------------------



2006-08-19 23:45pm

Today I:

- Fixed the text in a number of places
- Disambiguated MR 6:4.16

2006-08-20 03:12am

- Disambiguated MR 8:35.16

2006-08-20 03:41am

- Disambiguated:

  - LU 4:24.14
  - LU 14:26.31
  - JOH 18:34.4
  - 2CO 3:13.10

I found out, by reading Thayer, that E(AUTOU= can be both 1st and 
2nd person, as well as its default third.

That is what I'm going to check next... whether all instances of 
E(AUTOU= (1438) that are truly not 3rd person, have been assigned 
as such.

2006-08-20 08:10

I've finished checking all 316 instances of E(AUTOU=.

63 of them needed to be changed.  Done.

I've also removed BETA2GalatiaAndUnicode.py from word.py, instead 
using lib/morphgnt/convert.py.

Note that I still need to check whether the transition "'" --> "@" 
is valid in Galatia -- this is the only "improvement" that might 
be made to convert.py over BETA2GalatiaAndUnicode.py


2006-08-20 14:10

I received word from James that for numerals like xc#2 in RE 13:18.21, 
we should use U+0374 (Kaira) rather than U+2019 (apostrophe).  This 
URL confirms it:

http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/numerals.html

and the BETA encoding specification says that  Kaira is "#" in BETA.

So I've changed Tischendorf in RE 13:18.21 to have "#" rather than "'", 
and also recoced lib/morphgnt/convert.py to do this correctly.


2006-10-24 06:41am

Back in August, I checked all instances of E(AUTOU=.  At the time, I
wrote to Dr. Robinsons, who kindly wrote back and pointed out that in
Luke 17:14.7, I had written "F-APM" rather than the correct "F-2APM".

manual_analyses.txt:

-LU 17:14.7 EAUTOUS F-APM 1438
+LU 17:14.7 EAUTOUS F-2APM 1438


2006-12-07 01:00am

I found out that 3188 is a noun, so I changed the parsing from
adjective to noun.

manual_analyses.txt:

+2CO 3:3.11 MELANI N-DSN 3188
+2JO 1:12.10 MELANOS, N-GSN 3188
+3JO 1:13.9 MELANOS N-GSN 3188

ANLEX considers this an adjective, but Thayer and Strong agree that it
is a substantive, meaning "Ink" rather than 3189's "black" (ME/LAS).


2006-12-28 19:18pm

Today I received all of Dr. Robinson's databases.  This brings
whparsed up-to-date.

There are some 123 updates to Tischendorf due to this WH update.

I had to manually disambiguate one word as a result:

manual_analyses.txt:

+MR 10:26.7 EAUTOUS F-3APM 1438


2007-01-08 23:46PM CET

Today I received another shipment of WH from Dr. Robinson.  A few
parsings had changed.  I only needed to make one change, namely this
addition:

+RE 9:21.10 TWN T-GPF 3588

This is because Dr. Robinson had changed this word to T-GPN.  That is
understandable for W-H, because the next word reads "FARMAKWN" in W-H,
which is neuter.  But Tischendorf reads "FARMAKIWN", which is
feminine.


2007-05-17 23:45PM CET

Today I fixed this in manual analyses.

+LU 6:49.23 SUNEPESEN V-2AAI-3S 4098

It used to be 4842 ("SUMPE/MPW"), but it should be 4098 ("PI/PTW").
It would have been better with a lemma saying "SUMPI/PTW", but such a
lemma does not exist in Strong's.


2007-07-17 20:47PM CET

Today I:

- Got new DBs from Dr. Robinson
- Ran the processes on the new data
- Added the folowing disambiguation in manual_analyses.txt:

+AC 19:27.18 IERON N-ASN 2411


The new W-H DB resulted in 384 changes.


2008-01-20 12:10PM CET

Today I:

- Got an email from Peter Coad about some changes to the text, and one
  note about 2248 (H(MA=S) being ascribed to H(MEI=S regularly.  It
  should, of course be 2249 (H(MEI=S).
- Changed the lexicon.py:

-                        "HMIN" : ("2248", "P-1DP"),
-                        "HMAS" : ("2248", "P-1AP"),
-                        "HMEIS" : ("2248", "P-1NP"),
-                        "HMWN" : ("2248", "P-1GP"),
+                        "HMIN" : ("2249", "P-1DP"),
+                        "HMAS" : ("2249", "P-1AP"),
+                        "HMEIS" : ("2249", "P-1NP"),
+                        "HMWN" : ("2249", "P-1GP"),

- Fixed the text where Peter Coad's email said it should be fixed
  (plus many others that I found serendipitously).
- Released version 2.0 of the Tischendorf text.
- Wrote to Peter Coad.

I also made an innovation: When there is a & in a surface, it now
means "Kethiv&Qere".  That is, the Kethiv is what is in the printed
Tischendorf, but the Qere is what it should be (for whatever reason).

I also made it so that all Unicode stuff is written as NFC.
