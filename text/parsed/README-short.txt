The present work is Tischendorf's 8th edition of the Greek New
Testament, augmented with morphological information, Strong's numbers,
and lemmas.

Even though I am designated as the editor, the bulk of the work in the
preparation of this text was done by two other men, namely G. Clint
Yale and Maurice A. Robinson. Thus they deserve most of the credit for
the existence of this work.  Clint Yale provided the base Tischendorf
text, while Dr. Robinson provided a fully parsed and lemmatized
Westcott-Hort text on which the present morphological analysis and
lemmatization are based. I heartily thank them both.

The analysis was prepared by writing a software program to match the
Tischendorf text with Dr. Robinson's Westcott-Hort text.  In this
process, as much as possible of the Westcott-Hort analysis was brought
over to Tischendorf.  The remainder was supplied either through
careful manual analysis, or through the use of an analytical lexicon
which was constructed on an as-needed basis.  Finally, numerous checks
were made, using the linguistic search engine called "Emdros",
followed by manual correction where necessary.
